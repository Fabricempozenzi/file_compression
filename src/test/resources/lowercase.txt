In the land where whispers roam,
Beneath the moon's gentle dome,
A tale unfolds, a story untold,
In verses rich, in words bold.

Upon the canvas of the night,
Stars dance in celestial light,
Each twinkle a verse, a rhyme,
Echoing through the corridors of time.

From dawn's first blush to twilight's gleam,
Life's myriad hues in the poet's dream,
A symphony of emotions, a kaleidoscope,
In the poet's heart, a boundless scope.

In fields of green and mountains high,
Where eagles soar and rivers sigh,
Nature's poetry weaves its spell,
In every breeze, in every dell.

The whispers of the ancient trees,
The secrets carried by the breeze,
The murmurs of the rolling sea,
In every corner, poetry.

In the laughter of a child at play,
In the tears shed at the close of day,
In moments of joy, in moments of sorrow,
Poetry weaves its thread tomorrow.

Through wars and strife, through peace and calm,
Through every trial, every qualm,
Poetry stands, a steadfast guide,
In its embrace, we find our stride.

In love's embrace, in passion's fire,
In the depths of longing, of desire,
Poetry sings its sweet refrain,
In every heart, it leaves its stain.

So let us raise our voices high,
To the boundless reaches of the sky,
And in the language of the soul,
Let poetry's eternal flame unfold.

For in its verses, we find our truth,
In its rhythm, our eternal youth,
So let us cherish, let us adore,
The timeless beauty of poetry's lore.
